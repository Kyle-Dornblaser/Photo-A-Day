# Photo-A-Day
Photo-A-Day is a Python script that allows you to convert a folder of folders of yourself into a video slideshow. It attempts to find the largest face in the photos and centers and resizes the photos to 1920 x 1080. Many photos may end up being skipped in order to accomplish this.

Tested with Ubuntu 16.04.1 and Python 2.7.12
